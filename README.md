3. Next, get hold of a virtual environment _pip3 - sudo apt install python-pip_
4. Create the virtual environment _virtualenv venv_
5. Make sure you're working inside of it _source venv/bin/activate_
6. Install a pip dependencies file with _pip3 install -r pip_dependencies.txt_
7. Run it _python3 pass_gen.py_
